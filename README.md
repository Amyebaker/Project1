# Drawing Conclusions: How Education Impacts Income Across the United States

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore the income impact on higher education in the United States. We will be gathering data from 2019 to 2021 for those with a higher degree: Associates and Bachelor degrees, as well as those with no formal higher education.


### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* jupyter
* matplotlib
* spicy.stats

## Project Questions Addressed
In this project we address these three main questions:
1. What degree type (associates or bachelors) has the greatest impact on income?
2. What is the correlation between education levels (higher education vs no higher education) and income?
3. Which US Region has the highest amount of people with higher education degrees?


## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Instructions

1. //Prepare the data using the provided package dependency and data imports, merge the mouse_metadata and study_reults DataFrames into a single DataFrame. 2. //Display the number of unique mice IDs and check for any mouse ID with duplicate time points. Remove the duplicate and create a new Dataframe. Display the updated number of unique mice ID.
2. Generate summary statistics that shows a row for each [insert] and a column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation
3. Create [xxx] charts and [xxx] charts using both Panda DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib pyplot to show [what are we showing]
4. Calculate quartiles, find outliers of  across four of the most promising treatment regimens (state/region) and use Matplot to generate a box plot that shows [what does it show]
5. Create a [plot]
6. Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between degree and level of education and plot linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
